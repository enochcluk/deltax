## Inspiration
I usually only follow very important people on Twitter, and one of those is Donald Trump. He is always tweeting anything on his mind. I remembered how Elon Musks's tweets had moved the stock market, so I wondered if the same could be observed with Trump's. I assumed that the US Dollar Index was a good measure of confidence in our country.
## What it does
I used keras to classify tweets as either conducive to good days for the US dollar or bad days.
I also created a visualization for tweet volume compared to good and bad days for the S&P 500
And a wordcloud for fun
## How I built it
I used the knowledge from a Data Science class to collect and clean data in dataframes, then used a keras library I had encountered in google colab tutorials to do the language processing. data visualization was done with seaborn.
## Challenges I ran into
At first I looked for datasets on kaggle but I couldn't find any for stock prices or dollar index, but I found that yahoo finance had CSVs to download.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud that I was able to make a model that could "score" your own Trump tweet.
## What I learned
I've learned the usefulness of libraries such as Keras and improved my data science skills
## What's next for Trump Tweets and Stock Prices/Indices
I can see myself creating a website where users can input theoretical tweets and see how these should affect the US Dollar.
